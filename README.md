With the improvement of people&#39;s living standards, people&#39;s needs for health are becoming stronger and stronger. However, due to the 2020 epidemic, many people are more willing to buy health products online and conduct health consultations at home than going to physical pharmacies. Moreover, e-commerce represents the development direction of the future world, and it has become a general trend to establish an online medical and health service platform that meets people&#39;s needs.
